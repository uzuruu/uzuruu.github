                        [1] <i><b></b> 16 hour elevator ride </i></b> (2015) was a live performance by Sam Sam at the Elam School of Fine Arts. From 7:30 AM (when the school opens) to 11 PM (when the buildings are locked off), we occupied the space of a service elevator in the New Fine Arts 432 building (also known as the "Mondrian"). We set ourselves certain parameters to follow for the performance, such as no digital devices of any kind (except a camera that would be used for photographic documentation) or anything that could be used to distract ourselves (such as a book) or time keeping devices. The only thing we had to pass the time was each others company, and any conversation we had with one another and anyone who entered the elevator. Other parameters included everyone having the same things to eat for lunch and dinner, and only having one toilet break for each of us (an opportunity to go out of the elevator to use the bathroom for 5 minutes). This blurring and challenging of public and private space is prevalent in many performances by Sam Sam.

                        [1] This research video was the first I had made. It contains my documentation, writing and work made during the self-directed project of 2015. A lot of it was influenced by the collaborative work I did with Frida Lotz-Keegan and Emily Cloete; thanks guys!!!
