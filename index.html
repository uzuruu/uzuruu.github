    <h2>a manifesto</h2>
    <br>
    We propose:
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>To use our lives as platforms for art making. We aim to merge our work with the everyday. At times the process and the result are the same.</li>
      <li>We wish to further develop and unfold our own collaborative working partnership and the possibilities that it holds.</li>
      <li>Is it possible to make art collaboratively whilst maintaining a sense of self? Can a collective spirit of individuality be achieved?</li>
      <li>We pay respect to artists such as Gilbert and George and Fischli and Weiss. They are artists that grapple with
themselves in the everyday environment that they live in. They disrupt/devalue hierarchies found in contemporary
conventions in the art world and beyond, and play with their stigma.</li>
